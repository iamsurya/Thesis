\label{Chap:Intro}
This thesis considers the problem of tracking human wrist movements during free living.
This is motivated by the fact that wrist and hand movements can be used detect periods of eating
as shown in~\cite{dong2013detecting}. Further, with similar wrist motion data,
it is possible to track the amount of food that is being ingested by a person~\cite{dong2012new}.
Eating can occur at any time of the day, and it very hard to monitor the activity as such.
We propose a solution which uses a wrist watch like device to monitor how the wrist is moving throughout the day,
and store it on a memory chip. We consider the problem deuring free living,
because data from constrained living (consider a case where the test subject cannot move one hand)
have been shown to not accurately recreate the real life conditions created during the consumption of a meal.
\section{Motivation}
\label{Sec:Motivation}

 Obesity is an increasing problem. CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reports mention one
 \textemdash{} third of the adult American population as 
 obese, while sixty nine percent of the population is considered 
 overweight. The CDC defines individuals with a Body Mass
 Index of twenty five and above as overweight~\cite{ogden2010prevalence}.
 This number is rising in children too, with eighteen
 percent children between the ages of 12 \textemdash{} 18
 years considered obese. Modern advances in technology
 have helped our minds work without much thought into our action.
 Consider the example of driving a car, where your thought might drift
 into an event that happened during the day, but you are still able to drive the car.
 Similarly, not only is it easy to order prepared food, but eating
 food while watching television or using a computer makes
 it very easy to consume a large amount of calories quickly without
 noticing it happen. When a group
 of individuals was asked to count the number of bites taken over
 a 24 hour period, 40\% lost count or forgot the count entirely as mentioned in ~\cite{mahoney1975obese}.
 The abundance of fast food chains, high calorie food, and soda dispensers makes it very easy
 for a person to consume a large amount of calories without realizing 
 that they are doing so. Children who ate fast food, compared with those who did not,
 consumed an average of 187 kcal more every day ~\cite{bowman2004effects}.
 A study has shown that eating slowly is shown to help decrease the amount of calories
 consumed during a meal~\cite{Andrade2008}, however it is not an
 easy change to make in our busy lives, or one that can be sustained.

With the increase in smart phone sales,
we see a huge rise in small applications that help track our daily activities.
Applications like CalorieCount\footnote{Allows users to name and record calories consumed.
Users can pick from a database or enter their own values.} \cite{Web:CalorieCount} and MyFintessPal
\footnote{Allows users to pick various foods or exercises from a database or enter their own data} \cite{Web:MFP}
allow users to track their daily intake of food and also track other activities like exercise and sleep.
However, this data was still largely dependent on the user's ability to record these events,
and requires frequent user intervention and foresight.
It may be possible to create a device that could detect our movements,
predict what we are doing, and record this information autonomously.
Smaller sensors and components have allowed wearable devices to enter the market,
which allows these devices to be a part of clothing or accessories that contain
a microcomputer. This microcomputer can perform electronic functions that allow it to monitor and
detect human movement. Based on these detections, some kind of action can be performed.
These devices are shown to have a battery life of 24 to 48 hours.

Fitness trackers in the market currently offer a range of services. The Fitbit \cite{Web:FitBitOfficial},\cite{Web:FitbitFlex} and Jawbone \cite{Web:JawBoneWebsite} series of sensors allow for exercise and sleep monitoring using wrist movements. This data is then synchronized with a computer or a mobile phone, and can be viewed graphically by the user. Another consumer electronic segment that has now emerged is smart watches. These watches contain electronic components that make them functionally similar to a mobile phone, and are small enough to wear on the wrist. They contain low power displays and have a host of power saving techniques to have a long battery life. However most of the wearable devices on are limited to counting the number of calories expended and thus not many options exist for counting the number of calories consumed.

\section{Shimmer}
\label{Sec:Shimmer}

\end{figure}
Our application of using wrist movement to detect bites is very similar to biomedical research where the body is being monitored.
Similar constraints on the size of devices and battery life exist when they have to be used in biomedical research.
Burns et al. \cite{burns2010shimmer} have demonstrated a device called the SHIMMER,
which is an acronym for Sensing Health with Intelligence, Modularity, Mobility and Experiment Resusability.
The device is available in a small form factor (50mm X 25mm X 12.5mm),
and has a battery life of over twenty four hours with data from an acceleromter actively being recorded.
It features an MSP430 Ultra-low power microcontroller,
SD Card for storage,
a Bluetooth module for wireless communication,
and a lightweight battery (15).
It is possibble to connect an external sensor to the SHIMMER by using its general purpose I/O pins.
Figure \ref{Fig:ShimmerHand} shows a product photo of the device from the Shimmer website \cite{Web:ShimmerBuyKit}.
Power is extended by disabling most components when not needed.
\cite{burns2010shimmer} mentions that the duty cycle of writing to the memory chip or the bluetooth module can be reduced to save power,
however this is not possible in situations where the frequency is high because of the wake up time on these modules.
Shimmer sensing commercially provides these modules,
and a single base module can be purchased for US \$249 \cite{Web:ShimmerBuy}.
However, to program the SHIMMER base we would need access to the SHIMMER development KIT,
which costs US \$1999, or higher if additional features are required.

\section{Previous Work}
Our group has been involved with bite counting by tracking wrist motion for half a decade.
Initial research \cite{dong2012new} worked on identifying if this was a feasible idea.
During the early stages,
sensors were mounted directly on the wrist,
and a cable connected the sensor to a personal computer.
The computer would log data from the sensors and identify when the user took a bite of food.
Needless to say,
mobility by the user was limited,
and they would have to consume all of their meal within range of the computer cable.
Later work switched to a device that could process this information from the sensor in real time,
and predict the total number of bites taken by the user in a meal.
This device was able to store only the number of bites, 
but not the actual data captured from the sensors.
It was widely reviewed and reported by the media.
Figure \ref{Fig:BCEater} shows images from the research groups website showing the final device which was mass manufactured.

\section{Wearable Wrist Motion Tracker}
\label{Sec:WearbleTracker}
Work done in \cite{drennan2010assessment} shows a device that is capable of detecting bites by monitoring wrist movement.
We are motivated by the problem of monitoring calorie consumption by creating a wrist watch like device that automates the process.
Since the device is to be worn by the user everyday, it needs to be comfortable to wear.
This would required the device to have a small size.
To avoid having to recharge often, or risking the battery dying during a meal,
the device also needs to have a good battery life\footnote{Requiring a recharge not more than once a day}.
Our device records raw inertial movement data (Rotation and Acceleration), and stores this in a memory chip.
The configuration of the various axes is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:HandAxis}.
The data can later be accessed later using a computer and can processed by algorithms shown in
~\cite{dong2012new} to show when a bite of food has been eaten.
