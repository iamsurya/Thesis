\section{Motion Data Verfication}
\label{Motion Data}

Some of the characteristic movements and their resultant noticable signals are shown in table \ref{Tab:Signals}.

\section{Comfort Analysis}
\label{Sec:Comfort}

Table \ref{Tab:Comfort} shows the list of periods worn by each user,
and the rating they provided us with after the experiment.

\section{Device Comparison}
\label{Sec:Comparison}
As mentioned in the Introduction (\ref{Chap:Intro}),
multiple devices exist in the market that might perform features similar to our Wrist motion activity tracker.
Table \ref{Tab:Comparison} compares these devices.
