This is motivated by the fact that wrist and hand movements can be used detect periods of eating
as shown in~\cite{dong2013detecting}. Further, with similar wrist motion data,
it is possible to track the amount of food that is being ingested by a person~\cite{dong2012new}.
Eating can occur at any time of the day, and it very hard to monitor the activity as such.
We propose a solution which uses a wrist watch like device to monitor how the wrist is moving throughout the day,
and store it on a memory chip. We consider the problem during free living,
because data from constrained living (consider a case where the test subject cannot move one hand)
does not accurately recreate the real life conditions created during the consumption of a meal.
